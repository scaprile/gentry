Application
===========

Acconeer offers a comprehensive GUI for the Acconeer Exploration Tool to work with our sensors.
The tool is meant as a companion throughout your project; it should help you getting started quickly with testing and evaluating our sensor for your use-case, but also support you in finding the optimal sensor settings and fine-tuning the data processing for your final product implementation.

The general work-flow with the Exploration Tool GUI is described in the following:
