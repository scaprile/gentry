To support a new platform through this script, simply add a new PlatformInstaller-subclass and register(!) it.
The package that defines a new installer also needs to be imported, which can be done in src/acconeer/exptool/setup/platforms/__init__.py

See ./ubuntu_20_04.py for an example.

The rest will be handled automatically.
