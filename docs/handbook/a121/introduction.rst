============

The *sparse IQ* service is a new way of utilizing the Acconeer pulsed coherent radar (PCR) technology.
As the name implies, it producing complex (IQ) data points with essentially arbitrary distance spacing (sparse).
This gives the flexibility needed to set up the system for maximum efficiency across a wide range of applications.
