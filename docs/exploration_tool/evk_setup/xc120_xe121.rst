Setting up your XC120 + XE121
=============================

Flashing
--------
Start by downloading the latest ``acc_exploration_server_a121.bin`` from our `developer page <https://developer.acconeer.com/>`_.

Flash XC120 using the Exploration Tool Application

or by using the following command::

   python -m acconeer.exptool.flash -i acc_exploration_server_a121.bin

Windows USB drivers
-------------------

For enhanced stability and performance on Windows, we strongly recommend using the WinUSB driver to communicate with the XC120.
In order to do so, follow the steps below.

Download Zadig from their `website <https://zadig.akeo.ie/>`_.
We recommend version 2.7 or newer.

With the XC120 plugged in, run the Zadig application.

Under *Options*, select *List All Devices*:

Find the *XC120 Exploration Server* in the dropdown. Make sure *WinUSB* is selected as the driver to replace with. Now it should look like this:

Click *Replace Driver*. The process could take a minute. Once it's done, it should look like this:

All done! Now you can close Zadig and run the XC120 with the WinUSB driver.
In the app, select the XC120 like this:
